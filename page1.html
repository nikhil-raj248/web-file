     	<li>Copy of Work (sometimes called as checkout): It is the personal copy of all the files in a project. You can edit to this copy, without affecting the work of others and you can finally commit your changes to a repository when you are done making your changes.</li><br>

     	<li>git commitRecord the changes made to the files to a local repositery.For easy reference ,each commit has a unique ID.Its best practice to include a message with each commit explaining the changes made in a commit.Adding a commit message helps to find a particular change or understanding the changes.</li><br>

     	<li>git merge : Integrate branches together .git merge combines the changes from one branch to another branch.For example,merge the changes made in a staging branch into the stable branch.

     	<li>git fork :A fork is a copy of a repositery .Forking a repositery allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project</li><br><br>
